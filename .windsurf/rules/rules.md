- Do not change logic or API behavior
- Do not introduce new features
- Do not leave suggestions — apply changes directly
- Code must compile cleanly
- No inline comments; only keep doc comments above classes/functions if necessary
- Retain clean, idiomatic TypeScript — no `any` or unsafe assertions
