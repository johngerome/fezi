# Contributing to Fezi

Thanks for your interest in contributing to **Fezi**! ðŸŽ‰ This guide will walk you through the process of making changes and getting them merged.

## ðŸš€ Development Workflow

1. Fork this repository.
2. Create a feature or fix branch (`feat/your-feature` or `fix/your-bug`).
3. Make your changes and **build + test** before committing.
4. Open a **Pull Request** targeting the `main` branch.

## âœ… Commit Message Format

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://gist.github.com/johngerome/814554855beea7d4afc740994ec3972f) standard. Some examples:

- `feat(api): add user authentication`
- `fix(cli): handle empty config files`
- `chore(deps): update dependencies`

Use clear, meaningful messages â€” it helps keep our history readable.

## ðŸ“¦ Pull Request Guidelines

When opening a PR:

- **Title:** Use a one-line summary in Conventional Commits format.
- **Description:** Include:
  - A clear overview of what the PR changes
  - Why the change is necessary
  - Any relevant issues/tickets (e.g., `Closes #123`)
- It's totally fine to have multiple small commits â€” we'll squash on merge.
- Make sure all tests pass before requesting review.

## ðŸ§¹ Code Style & Quality

We use automated checks for:

- **Formatting**
- **Linting**
- **Type checking**

These run automatically on commit. If something fails, fix it up before pushing!
